# Exercise 1.10

Q: The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermannâ€™s function.
```scheme
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))
```
What are the values of the following expressions?
```scheme
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```
Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:
```scheme
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```
Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n^2.

A:
```scheme
> (A 1 10)
1024
> (A 2 4)
65536
> (A 3 3)
65536
```
Mathematical definitions for f, g and h:
```
f(n) = 2n
g(n) = 0, n = 0
       2^n, n > 0
h(n) = 0, n = 0
       2, n = 1
       2^2^2..(n times), n > 1
```
