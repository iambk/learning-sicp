# Exercise 1.9

Q: Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its arguments by 1, and dec, which decrements its arguments by 1.
```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
(define (+ a b)
(if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
````
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

A: Procedure 1
```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
```
As we can see clearly the process generated by this procedure is a linear recursive process, as the interpreter needs to keep track of the operations to be performed later on.

Procedure 2:
```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```
The process here is linear iterative process, as at any given point the interpreter only needs to know the state of the current procedure call.
